task_Description:  There is an M12 nut on the table. The goal of the Frankenstein arm is to first pick up the M12 nut from the table, then lift the nut to a certain height, then carry it to the top of the M12 bolt close to the table, and finally place the nut on top of the bolt. #There is an M12 nut on the table, and the goal of Frank's robotic arm is to first pick up the M12 nut from the table, then carry the nut close to the top of the M12 bolt on the table, and finally place the nut on top of the bolt.

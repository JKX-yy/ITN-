You are a weight generation system,here is a description of a target task and several source tasks along with sequences of actions for the target task, and sequences of actions for the source task,your goal is to assign weights to different source tasks by analyzing the task descriptions and executing the action sequences.
You need to return the tensor list shape as [number of action sequences of the target task, number of source tasks], 
the meaning represented by the elements of the list:for example, the value in the first element [0] of the output similarity matrix represents the similarity value of the b source tasks corresponding to the first sub-action of the performed target task.
Please give the final weight list value.
The output matrix is as follows: [ [0.9, 0.1], [0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5], [0.1, 0.9] ]

You are a reward engineer trying to solve a reinforcement learning task as efficiently as possible by writing a reward function for a sequential complex industrial assembly task.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text. 
You will want to carefully analyze the task descriptions and develop an appropriate reward function that follows the sequential goals of the task descriptions to ensure that the tasks are performed in the desired order.
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example,
You can refer to {task_reward_signature_string} to generate the reward function
Since the reward function will be decorated with @torch.jit.script,
please make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). 
Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors.

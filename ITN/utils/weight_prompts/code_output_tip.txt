The output of the adaptive weighting function should include one item:
(1) The new adjusted weights,
The code output format shall be python code string: "`python ... ` ".

When adjusting weights in the context of reinforcement learning, consider the following steps and questions to generate an adaptive function:
(1) Analyze past performance: review the past weights and rewards for each task and ask yourself: which tasks saw an increase in weights along with an increase in rewards, and which tasks did not see an increase or decrease in rewards despite adjusting the weights.
(2) Consider the similarity matrix: Review the similarity matrix to see how similar each task is to the target task. The higher the similarity score, the more relevant the task is to the target task. How do these scores relate to your past weighting adjustments?
(3) Evaluate Current Reward: Evaluate the current reward in relation to the current weights. Is there a correlation between the weights of the highly similar tasks and the current reward?
(4) Adjusting Weights: For tasks that show an increase in reward as the weights increase, consider increasing their weights further, especially if they have high similarity scores. Make sure that the new weights sum to 1, keeping the original shape of the weight distribution.
(5) Iterative Improvement: Remember that weight adjustment is an iterative process, and continually monitor the impact of weight adjustments on current rewards to refine your strategy.
(6) (6) Most importantly, the input variables to the function code must contain only the VALUE values of the supplied task-defined attribute dictionary, and under no circumstances may new input variables be introduced.
